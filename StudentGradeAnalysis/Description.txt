/*
Exercise: Student Grade Analysis
We have an array of student records, where each record has:
- name
- grades (array of numbers)
- attendance (percentage)

Your tasks:
1. Filter out students with attendance less than 80%
2. For remaining students, calculate their average grade
3. Map the results to create a summary for each student
4. Sort students by their average grade (highest first)
*/

const students = [
    { name: "Alice", grades: [85, 90, 92], attendance: 90 },
    { name: "Bob", grades: [75, 80, 85], attendance: 75 },
    { name: "Charlie", grades: [95, 88, 91], attendance: 85 },
    { name: "David", grades: [88, 89, 87], attendance: 95 },
    { name: "Eve", grades: [92, 93, 90], attendance: 88 }
];

// Try to solve these steps:

// 1. Filter students with >= 80% attendance
// Hint: use filter()

// 2. Calculate average grade for each student
// Hint: use map() and reduce()

// 3. Create summary objects with name and average
// Hint: use map()

// 4. Sort by average grade
// Hint: use sort()

Try solving this yourself first! Here's what your final output should look like:

[
    { name: "Charlie", average: 91.33 },
    { name: "Eve", average: 91.67 },
    { name: "David", average: 88 },
    { name: "Alice", average: 89 }
]
